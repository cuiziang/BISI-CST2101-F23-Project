# BISI-CST2101-F23-Project

# Description
Welcome to the 23 Fall - CST2101 Project! In this project, our goal is to analyze diabetes data from the Pima Indians tribe, addressing crucial business problems and questions. The primary focus is on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Model Training using Python. A notebook has been shared for the analysis, where certain parts are intentionally omitted and replaced with questions.

# Problem Statement
Diabetes, a prevalent global disease, has witnessed a steady increase in the number of patients over the years. While the exact cause of diabetes remains unknown, scientists emphasize the significant influence of both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle.


# Dataset Information
* The dataset comprises the following attributes:
* Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
* Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration 2 hours after an oral glucose tolerance test
* Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
* Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test
* BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
* Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
* Age: Age in years
* Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic, 1: the person is diabetic)
* Instructions for the Project
* Open the provided notebook for analysis.
* Fill in the gaps as per the instructions/questions in the notebook.
* Focus on Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Training using Python.
* Address the business problems/questions related to diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe.
